<h1 class="text-center">About me:</h1>
<p class="description text-center"> I am a very passionate individual. I like to make goals because it helps me stay on track with 
    my life and achievments. I started working out in late 2019 with the intent to do a body building show
    however, I did not have the right coach so I ended up not succedding. I personally wasn't ready for the challenage either which
    made it difficult to be successful. After that, I struggled a bit with alcohol, I got married went on my honeymoon
    and then covid hit. Covid was a weird time for everyone I beleive. In November of 2020 my husband lost his job.
    We had to sell our dream home, I quit alochol and we moved across the country without any jobs hoping he would
    land something good. It took about 6 months but he finally did. February of 2021, I hired my coach, went into a bulk
    and then went on a cut and did my first body building show in November 2021. I didn't win but I can tell you 
    the expereience taught me a lot about myself. Post show I struggled with binge eating and then I injured myself a 
    few days before my birthday. Up until June of this year I have been healing. June I started lifting again and also
    training for my first ever 10k. I have never been a long distance runner, I was more of a sprinter but I have 
    always wanted to be. My first race will be September of this year!</p>
